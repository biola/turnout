Turnout [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biola/turnout.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biola/turnout) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/biola/turnout.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/biola/turnout)
=======
Turnout is [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) middleware with a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) engine that allows you to easily put your app in maintenance mode.

Features
========
* Easy installation
* Rake commands to turn maintenance mode on and off
* Easily provide a reason for each downtime without editing the maintenance.html file
* Allow certain IPs or IP ranges to bypass the maintenance page
* Allow certain paths to be accessible during maintenance
* Easily override the default maintenance.html file with your own
* Simple [YAML](http://yaml.org) based config file for easy activation, deactivation and configuration without the rake commands
* Support for multiple maintenance page formats. Current [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
* Supports Rails, [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) and any other Rack application
* Supports multiple maintenance file paths so that groups of applications can be put into maintenance mode at once.

Installation
============
Rails 3+
--------
In your `Gemfile` add:

    gem 'turnout'

then run

    bundle install

Sinatra
-------

In your Sinatra app file

```ruby
require 'rack/turnout'

class App < Sinatra::Base
  configure do
    use Rack::Turnout
```

In your Rakefile

```ruby
require 'turnout/rake_tasks'
```

Activation
==========

    rake maintenance:start

or

    rake maintenance:start reason="Somebody googled Google!"

or

    rake maintenance:start allowed_paths="/login,^/faqs/[0-9]*"

or

    rake maintenance:start allowed_ips="4.8.15.16"

or

    rake maintenance:start reason="Someone told me I should type <code>sudo rm -rf /</code>" allowed_paths="^/help,^/contact_us" allowed_ips="127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/24"
    
or if you've configured `named_maintenance_file_paths` with a path named `server`

    rake maintenance:server:start

Notes
-----
* The `reason` parameter can contain HTML
* Multiple `allowed_paths` and `allowed_ips` can be given. Just comma separate them.
* All `allowed_paths` are treated as regular expressions.
* If you need to use a comma in an `allowed_paths` regular expression just escape it with a backslash: `\,`.
* IP ranges can be given to `allowed_ips` using [CIDR notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIDR_notation).

Deactivation
============

    rake maintenance:end

or if you activated with a named path like `server`

    rake maintenance:server:end

Configuration
=============

Turnout can be configured in two different ways:

1. __Pass a config hash to the middleware__

    ```ruby
    use Rack::Turnout,
      app_root: '/some/path',
      named_maintenance_file_paths: {app: 'tmp/app.yml', server: '/tmp/server.yml'},
      default_maintenance_page: Turnout::MaintenancePage::JSON,
      default_reason: 'Somebody googled Google!',
      default_response_code: 418
    ```

2. __Using a config block__

    ```ruby
    Turnout.configure do |config|
      config.app_root = '/some/path'
      config.named_maintenance_file_paths = {app: 'tmp/app.yml', server: '/tmp/server.yml'},
      config.default_maintenance_page = Turnout::MaintenancePage::JSON
      config.default_reason = 'Somebody googled Google!'
      config.default_response_code = 418
    end
    ```

__NOTICE:__ Any custom configuration should be loaded not only in the app but in the rake task. This should happen automatically in Rails as the `environment` task is run if it exists. But you may want to create your own `environment` task in non-Rails apps.

Default Configuration
---------------------

```ruby
Turnout.configure do |config|
  config.app_root = '.',
  config.named_maintenance_file_paths = {default: app_root.join('tmp', 'maintenance.yml').to_s},
  config.default_maintenance_page = Turnout::MaintenancePage::HTML,
  config.default_reason = "The site is temporarily down for maintenance.\nPlease check back soon.",
  config.default_response_code = 503
end
}
```

Customization
=============

[Default maintenance pages](https://github.com/biola/turnout/blob/master/public/) are provided, but you can create your own `public/maintenance.[html|json]` files instead. If you provide a `reason` to the rake task, Turnout will parse the maintenance page file and attempt to replace a [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/)-style `{{ reason }}` tag with the provided reason. So be sure to include a `{{ reason }}` tag in your `maintenance.html` file.

Tips
====

There is no `denied_paths` feature because turnout denies everything by default.
However you can achieve the same sort of functionality by using
[negative lookaheads](http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html) with the `allowed_paths` setting, like so:

    rake maintenance:start allowed_paths="^(?!/your/under/maintenance/path)"

A central `named_maintenance_file_path` can be configured in all your apps such as `/tmp/turnout.yml` so that all apps on a server can be put into mainteance mode at once. You could even configure service based paths such as `/tmp/mongodb_maintenance.yml` so that all apps using MongoDB could be put into maintenance mode.

Behind the Scenes
=================
On every request the Rack app will check to see if `tmp/maintenance.yml` exists. If the file exists the maintenance page will be shown (unless allowed IPs are given and the requester is in the allowed range).

So if you want to get the maintenance page up or down in a hurry `touch tmp/maintenance.yml` and `rm tmp/maintenance.yml` will work.

Turnout will attempt to parse the `maintenance.yml` file looking for `reason`, `allowed_ip` and other settings. The file is checked on every request so you can change these values manually or just rerun the `rake maintenance:start` command.

Example maintenance.yml File
----------------------------

```yaml
---
reason: Someone told me I should type <code>sudo rm -rf /</code>
allowed_paths:
- ^/help
- ^/contact_us
allowed_ips:
- 127.0.0.1
- 192.168.0.0/24
response_code: 503
```
